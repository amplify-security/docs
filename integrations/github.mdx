## Components

### GitHub App

The Amplify GitHub App installs in your GitHub organization and allows Amplify to make Requests
to the GitHub API on behalf of your organization. Amplify uses these privileges to receive
notifications about Pull Requests and GitHub Actions Workflows, and to commit security code fixes
directly to your repositories when approved by a user. Amplify also has the ability to open Pull
Requests and comment on Pull Requests to provide security feedback through the GitHub App.

### GitHub Action

The Amplify GitHub Action is an action that runs configured security tools on your GitHub repository 
and sends security findings to the Amplify Platform. The Amplify GitHub Action is installed in your
added GitHub repositories when you approve the installation Pull Requests created by the Amplify Platform.

### Amplify Workflow

The Amplify GitHub Actions Workflow is the workflow installed in any GitHub repositories added
to the Amplify Platform. This Workflow runs the Amplify GitHub Action on every Pull Request and
on every push to the repository's default branch.

```yaml .github/workflows/amplify.yml
---
name: Amplify Security
on:
  pull_request: {}
  workflow_dispatch: {}
  push:
    branches: ["master", "main"]

permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  amplify-security-scan:
    name: Amplify Security Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: (github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]')
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Amplify Runner
        uses: amplify-security/runner-action@v0.1.0
```

<Warning>
  The Amplify Platform currently relies on the name of the Workflow to track and display GitHub Workflows
  correctly. Do not change the name of the Workflow. This restriction will be lifted soon.
</Warning>
