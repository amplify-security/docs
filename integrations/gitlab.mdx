## Components

### GitLab Component

Amplify provides a GitLab component that must be installed in a GitLab Pipeline for any GitLab
projects added to the Amplify Platform. The following example pipeline configuration runs Amplify's
Runner component on every merge request. Using the tag `main` will always use the latest stable
version of the component. Pre-release or experimental versions will never be in `main`.

```yaml .gitlab-ci.yml
---
stages: [test]

include:
  - component: gitlab.com/amplify-security/components/runner@main
```

#### Specifying a component version

If you want to specify a particular Amplify component version, you can use our semantic version tags
instead of `main`. For example:

```yaml .gitlab-ci.yml
---
stages: [test]

include:
  - component: gitlab.com/amplify-security/components/runner@0.1.0
```
