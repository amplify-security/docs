## Overview

We're going to walk you through the steps to onboard your projects to Amplify.
The onboarding process was designed to be self-guided, so if you'd rather just follow
along in the Amplify App and skip this guide, you can do that too.

### What to expect

During onbording you will:

1. Install the Amplify GitHub App.
2. Select which projects you want to onboard.
3. Approve the Pull Requests that Amplify will open for you in selected projects. These Pull Requests
   add the Amplify Security GitHub Actions Workflow.

<Warning>
  You will need permission to install a GitHub App for the organization you want to secure with Amplify
  to complete this Quickstart guide.
</Warning>
