## What is Amplify Security?

Amplify Security is a cloud-native security platform that integrates industry leading security tools
into your development workflow and provides automtically generated code fixes for security vulnerabilities.

<Note>Amplify Security is currently in beta. Documentation and application functionality may change frequently.</Note>

## How Amplify secures your code

Amplify Security runs configured security tools on codebases that have been added to Amplify using
our [GitHub Action](https://github.com/amplify-security/runner-action). Amplify notifies developers 
of new vulnerabilities directly in their Pull Requests and provides available code fixes.

<Tip>Official documentation for running Amplify Security on GitLab and Bitbucket is coming soon!</Tip>

Our dedication to securing your code doesn't stop at new vulnerabilities. The Amplify
platform continously runs configured security tools on your codebase and generates new code fixes
as they become available for existing vulnerabilities. Once you've reviewed the available code fixes, 
you can open a Pull Request to apply the fix within the Amplify platform.

## Developer first security

Amplify is designed and built by developers for developers. We're tired of security products that both
get in the way and don't actually improve security just as much as you are. Our engineering team will
never stop thinking about what developers actually need to develop secure code with zero reduction to
velocity and without security theater.

## Core components

All of the core components that you need to secure your code with Amplify are open source and 
available for review.
